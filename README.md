MCGG-Xbot Predictor (Starter)
============================
This repository contains a minimal full-stack starter:
- backend/: FastAPI server (SQLite) for user management, matches, prediction
- mobile/: Kivy client (prototype) that talks to the backend
- .github/workflows/build.yml: GitHub Actions to build an Android APK with Buildozer

**Important**
- This is a starter/template. You must set up secrets, keystore, and deploy the backend (or run locally) before the mobile app can connect.
- See detailed step-by-step below in docs/SETUP.md
